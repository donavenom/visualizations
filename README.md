# Visualizations for Data Viz
## Jittered dot plot
![1-Jittered dot plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44620594/118350637-867dc300-b51d-11eb-975f-52c0f2dc2ee7.png)    
    
*Principle 1 - Maximizing the data-ink ratio*    
Unnecessary borders and lines were removed. The present lines -- the dotted horizontal lines -- serve as guiding markers to help viewers clarify which dots belong to which months as the dots extend further away from the name of the months found on the y-axis.

*Principle 2 - Mobilize every graphical element to show the data*    
I increased the plot margins to allow for more space between the dots and pushed out the x-/y-axis labels closer to the outer limits. I also scaled daily COVID-19 cases to thousands in order to maximize space.

*Principle 3 - Maximize data density and the size of the data matrix*    
At first, I played around with shrinking the data points but this effort made it more difficult to discern how many cases each dot represented. I ultimately chose to make the data dots a bit larger.

*Principle 4 - Escape flatland*    
I used color to display multivariate data (months and type of COVID-19 case).

*Principle 5 - Provide the user with an overview and details*    
The x-/y-axis are labeled appropriate to provide viewers with information to make sense of the graph. Further, I provided a legend describing what each color means. One thing I could have done, but admittedly had difficulty doing, is to provide a red diamond-shaped label in the legend indicating that the red diamond in the graph represents the month average of daily COVID-19 cases.

*Principle 6 - Utilize layering and separation*    
I used color to separate type of COVID-19 case (active vs deaths vs recovered). Also, I provided a particular color and shape to the month average of daily COVID-19 cases.

*Principle 7 - Utilize narratives of space and time*    
As a general benefit of dot plots, the position of a dot on its corresponding dotted horizontal line informs the viewer the space a) between each dot, b) between the dot and 0, and c) between each dot and the maximine value. These anchors provide a clear narrative to the viewer of the daily amounts of COVID-19 cases per month, which is the intention of the data visualization.

*Narrative analysis*    
The jittered dot plot illustrates daily amounts of COVID-19 cases -- broken down by month and type of case -- in the USA from October 2020 to March 2021. As can be seen from the visualization, the month of January 2021 saw some of the highest number of daily reported COVID cases, reaching up to 300,000, while the months of October 2020 and March 2021.


## Stacked histogram

*Narrative analysis*    
The stacked histogram illustrates the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases broken down by month and type of case. The months span March 2020 to March 2021. As can be seen from the visualization, the distribution for individuals who recovered from COVID-29 is greater than the number of active COVID-29 cases at each month starting from May 2020.
